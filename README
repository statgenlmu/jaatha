Jaatha's README
===============


Jaatha is a fast parameter estimation method primarily designed for Evolutionary
Biology. The method is described in 

> Mathew, L. A., Staab, P. R., Rose, L. E. and Metzler, D. (2013), 
> [Why to account for finite sites in population genetic studies and 
> how to do this with Jaatha 2.0][1]. Ecology and Evolution.

Practical instructions for running Jaatha are provided in the 
[The Jaatha HowTo][2]. Instructions how to use Jaatha with a non-standard 
simulation method are given in the [Custom Simulation Method HowTo][3]. Both
tutorials are also included as vignettes in the CRAN package. 

If you want to follow the development of Jaatha, you can do so on [GitHub][4]. 
Also, Paul posts development updates under [#jaatha on Google Plus][5].
