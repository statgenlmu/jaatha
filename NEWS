Version 2.3
---------------
Algorithm changes: 
  - Removed epsilon. We now stop the refined search after the
    likelihood did not improve for 10 consecutive steps.
  - Removed weight parameter to down-weight old simulations,
    because it had no measurable effect on the estimates.

New Features: 
  - Support for multiple groups of loci
  - Possibility to smooth arrays of arbitrary dimension

Improvements: 
  - Clarifies 'The Jaatha HowTo'


Version 2.2
---------------
+ Added function for calculating BCa confidence intervals
+ Added "rerun" option to initial & refined search 
+ Switched form doMC to multicore for parallelization
+ Support for multiple independent summary statistics, even though this is not 
  yet used in the default front end.
+ Differentiated between unit and integration tests and moved the unit tests
  back into the package.
+ Reworked the reusing of simulations from previous steps in the refined search.
  Now only simulations that actually are inside the current block are reused. 
+ Removed the "score". We are always using the log-likelihood now.
+ Added support for a new "poisson.smoothing" type of summary statistics. 

Version 2.1.3
-------------
+ Fixed problem with naming of temporary directories if Jaatha was executed
multiple times in different threads

-------------
+ Fixed problem with Rcpp in size_t on 64 bit windows

Version 2.1.1
---------------
+ Fixed warning messages in cpp files
+ Updated Makevars

Version 2.1
-------------
+ Removed the "externalTheta" option to simplify further development
+ Reworte and cleaned up many of the internal functions
+ Further seperated Jaatha and Demographic Model to simplify use of Jaatha
in other areas
+ Added caching for log factorials
+ Ported msFile2jsfs to Rcpp
+ Removed vignettes from the package due to their long build time; The pdfs will
be provided on Jaatha's homepage instead 
+ Added citation information to the package

+ Made fasta2jsfs calculate the folded JSFS if no outgroup is given.

Version 1.9.9
-------------
+ Reworked the demographic model class to be more flexible and consistent.
