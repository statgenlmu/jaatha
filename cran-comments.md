## General Comment
This a new major version of my package jaatha. It is backwards incompatible,
but there are currently no other packages depending on jaatha. The existing 
notes on the 'CRAN Package Check Results' page have been addressed.  

## Tasks from last release
As requested during the last release, this removes the term 'fast' from the 
package's title. 

## Test environments
* Ubuntu 15.10 (local), R 3.2.2
* Ubuntu 12.04 (on Travis-CI), R 3.2.2
* Windows (on AppVeyor), R-devel
* win-builder (R-devel and R-release)

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs, WARNINGs or NOTEs.

## Downstream dependencies
No packages are depending on jaatha.
