\title{Add migration/gene flow between two populations to a demographic model}
\usage{
dm.addMigration(dm, lower.range, upper.range, fixed.value, pop.from, pop.to,
  time.start = "0", par.new = T, new.par.name = "M", parameter)
}
\arguments{
\item{dm}{The demographic model to which recombination events should be added.}

\item{lower.range}{If you want to estimate the migration parameter (see note}

\item{upper.range}{Same as lower.range, but the largest possible value.}

\item{fixed.value}{If specified, the migration rate will not be estimated,
but assumed to have the given value.}

\item{pop.from}{The population from which the individuals leave.}

\item{pop.to}{The population to which the individuals move.}

\item{time.start}{The time point at which the migration with this rate
starts.}

\item{par.new}{If 'TRUE' a new parameter will be created using the
arguments 'lower.range' and 'upper.range' or
'fixed.value'. It will be named 'new.par.name'.
If 'FALSE' the argument 'parameter'
will be evaluated instead.}

\item{new.par.name}{The name for the new parameter.}

\item{parameter}{Instead of creating a new parameter, you can also
set the mutation rate to an expression based on existing
parameters. For example setting this to "M" will use
an parameter with name M that you have previously
created. You can also use R expression here, so "2*M"
or "5*M+2*tau" (if tau is another parameter) will also
work (also this does not make much sense).}
}
\value{
The demographic model with migration
}
\description{
This function adds the assumption to the model that some individuals
'migrate' from one sub-population to another, i.e. they leave the one
and become a member of the other. This is usually used to model ongoing
gene flow through hybridisation after the populations separated.
}
\details{
You can enter a time ('time.start') at which the migration is
assumed to start (looking backwards in time). From that time on, a
fixed number of migrants move from population 'pop.from' to
population 'pop.to' each generation. This number is given via this
feature's parameter, which equals 4*N0*m,  where m is the
fraction of 'pop.to' that is replaced with migrants each generation.
If 'pop.to' has also size Ne, than this is just the
expected number of individuals that migrate each generation.

You can add different mutation rates at different times to your model.
Then each rate will be used for the period from its time point to
the next. Migration from and to an population always ends with the
speciation event in which the population is created.

# Constant asymmetric migration
dm <- dm.createThetaTauModel(c(25,25), 100)
dm <- dm.addMigration(dm, 0.01, 5, pop.from=1, pop.to=2, time.start="0")

# Stepwise decreasing mutation
dm <- dm.createThetaTauModel(c(25,25), 100)
dm <- dm.addMigration(dm, 0.01, 5, pop.from=1, pop.to=2, new.par.name="M",
                      time.start="0")
dm <- dm.addMigration(dm, pop.from=1, pop.to=2, par.new=FALSE,
                      parameter="0.5*M", time.start="0.5*tau")
